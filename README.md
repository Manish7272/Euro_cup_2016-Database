# Euro_cup_2016-Database


Contains:

      1. All the tables (in .csv format)
      
      2. A .sql file containing all the queries I ran on the Euro_cup_2016-Database
      
      3. A .sql file containing all the solutions to the above queries.
      
This database has been taken from "w3resource" and the queries are taken from there as well.

The solution file has been created by me and contains my take on the queries.

All the queries are run on MYSQL WORKBENCH.
